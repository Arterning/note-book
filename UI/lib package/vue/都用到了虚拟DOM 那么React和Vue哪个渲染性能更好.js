It's difficult to say which one has better rendering performance between React and Vue, as both frameworks use highly optimized processes that are designed to be fast and efficient. The rendering performance of either framework will depend on a variety of factors, such as the complexity of the components, the size of the data being rendered, and the optimization techniques used.

In general, both React and Vue are designed to be highly performant and are able to handle large amounts of data and complex user interfaces. However, it's important to note that the actual performance will depend on the specific use case and how the framework is used.

That being said, both React and Vue have large and active communities that are constantly working to improve the performance of their respective frameworks, so it's likely that both frameworks will continue to improve and evolve over time. In the end, the choice between React and Vue will depend on a variety of factors, including your personal preferences and the specific requirements of your project.
