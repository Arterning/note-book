Adding Maven dependency with command line

I've just installed Maven 3 - I'm new to Java and I want to learn how Maven works. For now, I know that I can add a dependency by editing POM file in the maven project, but I wonder if there is a 'clean' way to do it with command line. Running Windows 8.1, Java 8, Maven 3.
