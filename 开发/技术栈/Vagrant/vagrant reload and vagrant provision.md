`vagrant reload` restarts the virtual machine, applying any configuration changes that may have been made to the Vagrantfile.

`vagrant provision` reapplies provisioning to the running Vagrant environment. This means that any provisioning scripts or configuration management tools will be run again on the running machine.

In summary, `vagrant reload` restarts the virtual machine, while `vagrant provision` reapplies provisioning to the running environment without restarting the virtual machine.
