/**
 * what is the advantage to user dozer?
There are several advantages to using Dozer for Java Bean to Bean mapping:

Simplicity: Dozer provides a simple and straightforward way to map Java Beans without having to write tedious and error-prone code for copying field values.

Flexibility: Dozer supports mapping between different bean classes, including mapping between beans with different field names or data types. This makes it easier to map objects between different systems and data persistence layers.

Performance: Dozer is designed to be fast and efficient, providing a high-performance solution for large-scale data mapping needs.

Maintains consistency: Dozer ensures that all field values are mapped consistently, reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs into your code.

Supports bidirectional mapping: Dozer supports bidirectional mapping, making it easy to map objects in both directions, such as mapping from a database object to a Java bean and vice versa.

Extensible: Dozer can be easily extended and customized to meet specific mapping requirements, such as custom data conversions or custom mapping rules.

Overall, Dozer provides a convenient and efficient way to map Java Beans, reducing the amount of manual coding required and increasing the reliability of your mapping code.
