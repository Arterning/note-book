Your page content depends on external data: Use getStaticProps.
Your page paths depend on external data: Use getStaticPaths (usually in addition to getStaticProps).

 // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404.


 We recommend using Static Generation (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

On the other hand, Static Generation is not a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

如果你的页面需要显示需要经常变化的数据 那么这个页面就不适合提前渲染
