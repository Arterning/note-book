Angular uses a different approach to rendering components compared to React and Vue. Angular uses a concept called "change detection" to determine when the component's state has changed and needs to be re-rendered.

In Angular, change detection works by running a digest cycle that checks for changes in the component's state. If a change is detected, Angular will update the component's template and render it again. This process happens automatically, and developers don't need to manually trigger re-renders.

Angular does not use virtual DOM technology in the same way that React and Vue do. Instead, Angular updates the actual DOM directly when the component's state changes. This approach is known as "dirty checking," and it can be more efficient than virtual DOM-based approaches in some cases, especially for small and simple components.

In general, Angular's approach to change detection is highly optimized and is able to handle large amounts of data and complex user interfaces. However, the performance of Angular's change detection process can be affected by the complexity of the components, the size of the data being rendered, and the frequency of changes to the component's state.

Overall, Angular's approach to rendering is different from React and Vue, but it is highly optimized and is able to handle complex user interfaces effectively. Whether Angular is a better choice than React or Vue will depend on the specific requirements of your project and your personal preferences.
