Node.js uses a single thread for executing JavaScript code by default, but it uses multiple threads under the hood for performing other tasks, such as handling I/O operations.

When multiple users simultaneously access a Node.js application, the application can handle the requests using an asynchronous, non-blocking model. This means that the Node.js application will receive the incoming requests and respond to them as soon as it is able, without waiting for any one request to complete. This approach allows Node.js to handle many requests efficiently, even with a single thread.

If your Node.js application needs to handle a very large number of concurrent connections, you can use additional techniques to scale the application, such as:

Clustering: Using the built-in cluster module to run multiple instances of your application on different worker processes.

Load balancing: Using a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of your application.

Microservices: Breaking down your application into smaller, independent components that can be run on separate instances or even separate machines.

These techniques can help you scale your Node.js application to handle a large number of concurrent users. However, the specific approach you should use will depend on the requirements of your application and the resources you have available.
